    we can see that, it is not nesseary to add JAVA_HOME into PATH, we can directly add the absolute path of bin in the jdk into PATH. But it wil be helpful when we there are more than one versions of jdk.

The code 'helloworld' in java as the following shows.
```java
public class test{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello"+"World");
    }
}
```
